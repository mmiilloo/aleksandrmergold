								"&ldquo;If AAP wishes to remain at the forefront of design and architecture, I would urge them to invest and reward those faculty members, like Aleks, who have devoted years of their careers to mentor, teach, and guide AAP’s students. Aleks offers a unique perspective within the Cornell academic setting. As a graduate of Cornell, I can guarantee that my current success owes a debt of gratitude to the diverse teaching methods and varying approaches to architecture of the visiting professors. Aleks among them, these are the professors AAP needs.

								"&ldquo;I worked closely with Aleks in the spring of 2014 when CUSD collaborated with the sophomore architecture studio to design for the a plot of land we were building on in Petit Goave, Haiti. He was very communicative and I remember having a lot of respect at the time for his desire to give parameters based on our project that would also help optimize the learning experience of the students (by not over constraining). The result was a project that allowed the sophomore architects to feel like they were competing on a real-world design competition, but without the constraints forcing every design to be the most practical. We ended up with very engaging designs&hairsp;—&hairsp;some which focused on practicality given the community and some that really pushed the boundaries of what we imagined.

								"&ldquo;Aleks is one of those professors who has the ability to change your life. He helped me understand how to tell a story through design, how space can have its own agency, and most importantly, the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. He has had an incomparable role on my academic, personal, and professional development, and I cannot thank him enough. Losing Aleks is a loss, not just for Cornell Architecture, but all the design disciplines at Cornell University. My experience at Cornell would not have been the same without him, and it pains me to imagine the loss of that experience for future Cornellians due to his impending absence.&rdquo;<br><br>—Pamela Chueh, B.Arch &rsquo;17 / Design Strategist at Gensler",
								"&ldquo;As a graduate of Cornell, I owe my ability and enjoyment of design to several key instructors and mentors who have shown me a designer's capacity to effectively make change in the world rather than emulate the status quo, of whom Aleks stands out as a stellar example. Aleks is one of those once-in-a-career instructors whose genuine support, mentorship, and formidable skill really showed me what an educator could be. I remember the way he treated us like thesis students during an option studio with him, and really let us think critically through our own projects to emerge with a true sense of growth and ownership. It is to the department's advantage to recognize the value and rarity of this.&rdquo;<br><br>—Madeleine Eggers, B.Arch &rsquo;19 / Teaching Associate &rsquo;19-&rsquo;20",

In a playfully serious manner, he engages those around him in a dialogue that broadens their view of what architecture is and can be. I am deeply grateful towards him and he was the best part of my experience at Cornell. To this day, he is one of the most inspiring people I know. When one interacts with Aleks, they are reassured of the potential and agency of design. His generosity makes us optimistic too about the future. Especially now, it is critical for designers to contribute to larger society and engage in challenging conversations. Aleks teaches us this through example. His voice and presence are essential.&rdquo;<br><br>—Andrew Fu, B.Arch &rsquo;15 / Associate, SO-IL",

								"&ldquo;As a student in several of his core studios and seminars, I can say that Prof. Mergold not only stood out to me as an incredibly talented architect, but also an incredible human being. His pedagogical approach is not only sound and rigorous, but also deeply empathetic&hairsp;—&hairsp;a quality that is clearly visible in his personal work and in his students' projects. We as architects have a moral and ethical responsibility with society, and Prof. Mergold's pedagogical approach was always deeply emphatic of this aspect. Looking in hindsight now that I'm a registered practitioner in the field, I always found that Cornell's approach was often too prescriptive. Whilst most faculty encouraged the kind of rigorous analogue approach developed at the height of modernism, the truth is that this approach is completely out of touch with the realities of the profession in the twenty-first century. The practice has evolved, and Prof. Mergold's approach was reflective of this undeniable truth. As a student, I always found that the divide between academia and practice at Cornell was particularly profound, as many faculty had never actually built a building. In this sense, I found that Prof. Mergold was unique among Cornell faculty. Not only does he have a robust portfolio of built work, but he is actively creating opportunities within the programme to bridge the gap between academia and practice. His approach strikes careful balance between rigour, boldness, and innovation&hairsp;—&hairsp;qualities we desperately need in the industry now more than ever. I'm genuinely shocked to hear he was not granted tenure, and even more shocked to hear he was not granted a right of appeal. Prof. Mergold is not only an outstanding thinker, a dedicated instructor, and a prolific practitioner, but he is also a long-standing member of the AAP community. He is a Cornellian and Ithacan at heart (something very few architecture faculty today can actually say), and his integrity as a practitioner, an educator, and as a human being are truly admirable. I believe the opaqueness in this process is detrimental Cornell's image, as it seriously undermines the trust we put in the University. I would like to urge the office of the Provost to reconsider their decision and grant a right of appeal. I believe this is well deserved as a matter of respect&hairsp;—&hairsp;not only to Prof. Mergold, but also to his countless students, most of whom are now successful alumni around the world and owe their success in no small measure to Prof. Mergold's inspiring work.&rdquo;<br><br>—Mauricio Vieto, B.Arch &rsquo;13 / Senior Architectural Professional, SOM",

His students' thesis research projects push boundaries in imaginative critical ways examining both the human condition, history, place, and material exploration. The work done with various design build projects required immense rigor and the students involved acquired design and construction skills unparalleled in the classroom. Cornell AAP has a long history and lineage of design thinking through making, which embodies the courses Professor Mergold crafts and teaches. The most important thing I have learned from Aleks has been embracing the perfection in the imperfection, through a particular critical lens.

								"&ldquo;Aleks not only book-ended my Cornell experience, serving as my first-year professor and my Thesis Advisor, but he also had a huge impact on the rest of my Cornell years as well. His versatility, earnestness, understanding, and unique perspectives continually inspired and challenged me to be a better architect. It is rare to find a professor that has such a positive impact on such a large quantity of students and faculty, and I think that should be an obvious reflection of his high standards of excellence. Without a doubt, Aleks was my most impactful professor at Cornell and should 100% be granted tenure, but at the very least, be given the ability to appeal this decision.&rdquo;<br><br>—Mary Bray Erickson, B.Arch &rsquo;14 / Job Captain, William Duff Architects",

Aleks’ criticism was sincere, his lessons fun, and his content illuminative and unique. From him, I learned not to worship some old theorist, but rather my own subjective taste and experience. I was encouraged by Aleks to expand my experiences far beyond the school of architecture/Cornell, and to work with my quirks and biases rather than against them. Aleks made it clear that as designers, we should be full of a healthy mix of ideas, opinions (be they conflicting or not), and a willingness and excitement to fail, rather than simply romantic pedagogical bullshit and lofty tautologies. Aleks’ opinion wasn’t gospel&hairsp;—&hairsp;nobody’s is&hairsp;—&hairsp;and that was the greatest lesson he could have ever taught us, and it’s easily the most widely applicable and valuable thing I learned while at Cornell.<br><br>Not offering Aleks a position amongst the faculty does a disservice to the school, and its students.

								"&ldquo;I haven't had the pleasure of being officially taught by Mergold in an elective or studio setting, but I have interacted with him on reviews, meetings, day to day settings. He has never turned down a plea for help, and has always generously made him self available, often going above and beyond. His spirit, energy, rigor, and commitment to a radically interdisciplinary architecture is evident in his body of diverse work; which also shines through in the work of students who have been lucky enough to have him. It would be a great loss to not only the Architecture Department, but the Cornell community at large to loose him.&rdquo;<br><br>—CoCo Tin, B.Arch &rsquo;19 / Architectural Designer & Research",

His unique outlook on the world and insight into design and architecture were instrumental in shaping me as a designer and as a person. He was also there for me whenever I was struggling to help guide me through problems big and small. His sharp intellect, boundless curiosity, patience, kindness, and humor set him apart as one of my favorite, most influential, and most important professors that I had the privileged of studying with during my time at Cornell.

He is truly dedicated to the craft and expression of architecture's expanded field, and he has the unique ability to inspire students to excel past their constraints. Beyond the critical aspirations that drive his work and teaching, his devotion to academia outside the conventional bounds of architectural design is unparalleled. Aleks is an exemplary educator, and I suspect few others can embolden such a legion of students to speak in their defense, so I advocate not just for Aleks, but the future Cornell students that may be without his design instruction.&rdquo;<br><br>—John Lura, M.Arch &rsquo;11 / Architect, FXCollaborative",
								"&ldquo;I've known Aleks since 1995; we were both undergraduates at Cornell in the architecture program. We have continued to work with each other over the last twenty years since graduating. At the University at Buffalo, we ask him to serve as a guest critic at our school for architecture reviews whenever possible because of the energy and knowledge he brings to our reviews. His CV should speak for itself; he is an award winning designer, a fantastic teacher, and a treasured mentor to his students.

The latter, however, has largely been left to chance, through option studios taught mostly by visiting critics. Chance has largely left me with disappointment; mainly due to the abrupt discontinuity and shattering of architectural thinking imposed by research-oriented professors who are educated in different schools of thought and have little understanding of Cornell's.

I learned a lot from Aleks about how to generate ideas in an organic and critical way. He was a professor that really taught me how to think, and some of my favorite work from my time at Cornell come from his option studio (an option studio I chose solely for the reason that he was teaching it, actually). I also really respect Aleks involvement with student organizations and other “extra” curriculars&hairsp;—&hairsp;I remember him as one of the biggest faculty advocates for student initiatives, him being the faculty advisor for at least three different organizations I was involved with.

						"&ldquo;Was a student of Aleks’ this past Spring 2020 semester, and feel incredibly indebted to his knowledge, guidance, and efforts this semester in helping me grow as a designer, thinker, and student.&rdquo;<br><br>—Praveen Menon, M.Arch &rsquo;22",
					"&ldquo;I had the privilege of taking a studio with Aleks twice (once in 2018 and another this past spring after a hiatus from school). In both studios, I was able to experience the design process in a completely different perspective from what I had learned in my undergrad education as well as from other faculty in the department. His ability to not only offer unique ways to clarify the never-ending design process, as well as expanding on that clarity, has helped me made huge strides of progress in the way I think about architecture. In addition to his dedication to the education of his students, Aleks has been incredibly approachable and genuinely enthusiastic about helping students achieve their goals. It was disheartening to find out about his denial of tenure and even more so to imagine a pedagogy without his contribution. I sincerely hope that an appeal can be made based on the outstanding number of students and peers that support his endeavors.&rdquo;<br><br>—Kevin Park, M.Arch &rsquo;22",
				"&ldquo;Alex was an extremely important aspect of my education at Cornell and I find it very unnerving he was not granted tenure. Participating in the summer traveling studio Alex organized in 2012 was the most influential experience I had at school, I feel constantly grateful for the amount of thought and coordination Alex put into that studio and everything he showed us. To me, Alex teaches such an important and refreshing perspective on design that would be gravely missed at Cornell if he were to not be there. Alex introduced me (and so many others!) to a way of thinking about architecture and design from an emotional point of view, he is one of a few professors who truly makes Cornell's program unique and stand apart from other universities. I will never forget the lecture he gave on the Skogskapellet cemetery chapel during his theory class in the fall of 2011, it was without question the most moving and memorable class period I had in school.&rdquo;<br><br>—Tyler Barker, B.Arch &rsquo;14 / Associate, Volley Studio",
			"&ldquo;Aleksandr’s past two decades of accomplishment are confirmed by his large number of awards, lectures, articles/books, exhibitions, academic pursuits, teaching agendas, course outlines and conceptualized + built architectural projects. For my emphasis here, I want to credit his design/theory and constructed works as evidence of an extremely valuable influence on students, colleagues and architectural scholarship in general. One of the key elements of Aleksandr’s relevance today is his relationship in the new initiative of ‘degrowth’ as a cornerstone of sustainability. This fusion of disciplines is particularly valuable in a university context, because students are encouraged to become simultaneously engaged in conceptual thought, research, technology and a hands-on experience with construction . . . plus writing, graphic design and publication, when a project is translated into media outreach. In view of the lessons being imparted by the global environmental crisis and, subsequently, from the coronavirus pandemic, Aleksandr’s basic emphasis on an ‘economy of means’ is the most progressive and urgently needed aspect of his educational message for today and for the future.&rdquo;<br><br>—James Wines, President of SITE NY",
		"&ldquo;I was classmates with Alex at Cornell; he was one of the most talented individuals I’ve ever met in my life. Also one of the most generous and diligent, and an inspirational mentor and educator. I fully support him with the highest level of endorsement.&rdquo;<br><br>—David Huang, B.Arch &rsquo;00 / Designer, Apple Inc",
	"&ldquo;Aleks was on my final review panel this semester, and his comments and critiques were very helpful in understanding visual representation from a new lens. I was excited to have the opportunity to have him as a professor some time in the future and I don’t want to lose this opportunity. One of the main reasons I chose to study at Cornell is because of the great faculty and professors, and it would be a shame to lose one.&rdquo;<br><br>—Austin Couch, B.Arch &rsquo;24",
"&ldquo;Aleks was my instructor for Spring 2020. He, along with Tao, was a fantastic instructor to support, develop, and amplify every students' perspective in architecture. Every single one of my cohorts has a distinctive design style with solid execution, and Aleks was playing a huge role. He finds a value out of every one of us. He tries to understand students' work by often saying, and I quote, 'That's quite amazing, actually,' Also, his attitude towards education is very open-minded. All of these characters devote to AAP's diverse work. He would be an excellent resource for the department and its future development, and also for upcoming students. I advocate for him to stay at Cornell. Please consider!&rdquo;<br><br>—San Yoon, M.Arch &rsquo;22",
"&ldquo;Mergold deserves recognition for his genuine investment in his students and the communities in which his design studios are situated. His devotion to professional practice in addition to academia is unique and valuable.&rdquo;<br><br>—Cameron Neuhoff, B.Arch &rsquo;16 / Designer, Carpenter – Studio Ferrari Architecture",
"&ldquo;I absolutely loved his class. I had him for architectural analysis. He is an enthusiastic teacher and his lectures were refreshing, integrative and cross-cultural.&rdquo;<br><br>—Maiko Sein, B.Arch &rsquo;23",
"&ldquo;An inspirational teacher and advisor&rdquo;<br><br>—Daniel Halstead, B.Arch &rsquo;23",
"&ldquo;Aleks brims with talent and passion and harnesses a unique ability to make anyone love architecture as much as he does. Cornell APP is making a terrible mistake and must reconsider its decision.&rdquo;<br><br>—Effrain Perez, B.Arch &rsquo;99",
"&ldquo;Aleks Mergold's landscapes and edgy interventions embrace the historic incorporating circular design principles that are at the core of creatively reimagining the world as a newly urban space in which nothing gets truly thrown out. He not only imbues this ethos but inspires as a teacher and practitioner. He offers students and colleagues on campus and in the field the rare hope that architecture and place matters at a time in which they are badly needed.&rdquo;<br><br>—Dr. Elissa Sampson, Urban Geographer, Lecturer, Jewish Studies, Cornell University, College of Arts & Sciences",
"&ldquo;Mergold’s Arch Analysis course developed my architectural critical thinking skills exponentially. It allowed me to see not only architecture, but life as a whole through an entirely new lens. It was one of the highlights of my second year in the B. Arch program&rdquo;<br><br>—Juliana Zalzman, B.Arch &rsquo;23",
"&ldquo;While I have not had Mergold, I have always enjoyed hearing him speak on reviews and listen to what he has to say. In addition, I was excited to take a studio or elective with him in the future.&rdquo;<br><br>—Remy Mermelstein, B.Arch &rsquo;22 / ESL Researcher",
"&ldquo;My comprehensive design studio with Professor Mergold during second year was one of the most formative experiences I had during core. His curriculum as well as instruction led me to realize work that has held up as one of my best projects to date. In fact, my partners and I still feature our project, Spoli(w)all, in our design portfolios. While I am unaware of the nuances that have led you to this decision, I can attest through my own experience that Professor Mergold is an exceptional educator and an asset to the program.&rdquo;<br><br>—Mikki Heckman, B.Arch &rsquo;18 / Architectural Designer, PGAL",
"&ldquo;I was lucky to have three opportunities to work with Aleks in my studio (as an intern, after his undergraduate degree and after his graduate work) giving me a perch from which I watched him develop from a very bright and talented student to a unique intellect, teacher and practitioner in the global architectural community. His contributions to my studio were unparalleled, helping define a body of work that, even today, define the essence of our approach.<br><br>I've been a student at AAP, a repeat visiting critic teaching a variety of undergraduate and graduate students, a lecturer and someone who is proud of what Cornell was historically, and what it is now, and I am truly concerned that such a distinct asset is being passed over.<br><br>Aleks is a bridge from the AAP I attended to the one now consistently ranked as the paragon of architectural education. He seems as critical to Cornell as he was to me in my work, and I genuinely hope that he will be given the opportunity to make the case for continuing his contributions at Cornell.&rdquo;<br><br>—James Biber, B.Arch &rsquo;76 / Founding Principal, Biber Architects",
"&ldquo;I've only ever had one class with professor Mergold, yet it should go far to say that throughout that semester I wouldn't dare skip a lecture. Our professor's creativity with the course was refreshingly and eye-openingly daring. I hope each signature is not taken lightly.&rdquo;<br><br>—Eunice Lee, B.Arch &rsquo;23",
"&ldquo;Aleks is a singularly talented architect and educator whose interdisciplinary work and alternative approaches to sustainable design is urgently needed in the profession.&rdquo;<br><br>—David Allin, B.Arch &rsquo;00 / Associate Principal, Diller Scofidio + Renfro",
"&ldquo;I write in full support of the appeal of Aleks Mergold's denial of tenure at Cornell. I've been a part of the Cornell Community since my arrival in Ithaca in the Fall of 1969. I've only known a few great professors, teachers who cared as much about the student as the subject they were teaching, teachers who I treasured because I was a human being to them, I was a spark that needed to be kindled. Aleks Mergold is one of those exceptional professors. I met Aleks while shooting a film about my wife's journey back to Central Europe with Aleks and 13 of his students. His leadership and inspiration led the students in a design workshop that imagined what one critic termed &lsquo;truly an Architectural amelioration of the pain of The Holocaust&rsquo;.<br><br>We have lots of film evidence of Aleks in action and his value to his students and we are happy to share it with you if you would like to see it. Aleks also was on the stage at the Center for Jewish History in New York when the film of his student's efforts was shown to an overflow audience. Aleks represented Cornell as only a devoted Prof of Architecture at Cornell could hope to do. Please reconsider the, in my opinion capricious, denial of tenure to a very exceptional and fully qualified candidate for Professor at AAP Cornell.&rdquo;<br><br>—Philip Wilde, BS Biology &rsquo;73 / Film Maker, Cornell Alumnus",
"&ldquo;Aleks was an intellectual inspiration.&rdquo;<br><br>—Alex Stojković, B.Arch &rsquo;16 / Lothrop Associates LLP Architects",
"&ldquo;This document includes hundreds of voices, from across continents and age groups, coming together in support of a professor who has encouraged students and colleagues to question our understanding our the built environment, develop one's personal design ethos, and *think creatively*. If this is not 'global visibility' for a professor, then what is?&rdquo;<br><br>—Adriana R. Pliego AIA, B.Arch &rsquo;08",
"&ldquo;Aleks does great work and it's crazy his commitment and passion for the broad world of architecture in it's amazing iterations/shapes/specialties. Alek carries an enourmous presence in the school and I can't imagine why he would not be the perfect candidate for tenure. He's so talented and more importantly, a great inspiration to the student body of how one can dive deeply into the academic/theoretical world while also keeping one foot in the practice of a small forward thinking firm. I am confused as to what Cornell Architecture stands for if it does not include Aleks Mergold in it.&rdquo;<br><br>—Leslie Mignin (now Mather), M.Arch &rsquo;11 / Partner/Founder of Bristow Mather and Senior Designer/architect at Walgreens",
"&ldquo;If I understand correctly the language about the tenure process in Cornell's faculty handbook, and if indeed the University has bypassed the right to appeal as stated in the letter above, then I strongly urge Cornell to follow its written policies. To not do so would seriously affect a valued faculty member and teacher, and would also decimate the credibility of the system, drawing a cloud of arbitrariness to the institution.&rdquo;<br><br>—Javier Arbona, B.Arch &rsquo;99 / Assistant Professor, American Studies / Design, University of California–Davis",
"&ldquo;I had several classes taught by Aleks. He always demonstrated an enthusiasm for the profession and his students. He brought a wealth of knowledge and a unique perspective on the subject of architecture and its interpretation across fields. He served as an adviser for myself and another student to fulfill an independent study. He always put the interests of his students above his personal work. I believe he has earned a tenured position at this institution.&rdquo;<br><br>—Cristina Johnson (Marais), M.Arch &rsquo;12 / Registered Architect at TMS Architects",
"&ldquo;Aleks Mergold is one of my favorite professors at Cornell. He is a super talented and creative professor who has tons of amazing ideas and topics not only about architectural design but also regarding discourse, practicality, and even mechanism. It would be a great loss for Cornell if Mergold left in the future. I hope he can stay and bring more fresh thoughts to the students and the school.&rdquo;<br><br>—Yilin Zhang, M.Arch &rsquo;19 / Architectural designer",
"&ldquo;Aleksandr is a brilliant, free spirited instructor who passionately teaches and pushes for a progressive mindset amongst his students. Being fortunate enough to have been in his studio this pass Spring, I've seen firsthand the level of commitment he has for his students, especially in troubling times with COVID-19. He consistently is providing ways of approaching our individuals projects, putting aside any preconceived idea he might have so that our own voices and designs can shine through. He brings such an energetic, critical basis for understanding for architecture, which I, and many others can agree will be of great benefit for architecture department for years to come! Please take this into immense and critical consideration, as we are all in his support! He deserves an appeal to this decision, WE deserve him!&rdquo;<br><br>—Carlos Blanco, M.Arch &rsquo;22",
"&ldquo;Prof. Mergold is deeply involved with the department, his students, and faculty&hairsp;—&hairsp;it would be deeply upsetting and a sincere shame for future students to never be able to learn from, and be taught by him.&rdquo;<br><br>—Erin Huang, B.Arch &rsquo;22",

"&ldquo;He is a wonderful professor and mentor&rdquo;<br><br>—Frances Gain, M.Arch &rsquo;10 / Associate Strategest",
"&ldquo;Aleks is one of the very few professors within the college of architecture that has the capacity to inspire students to imagine methods and practices beyond the status quo. There is within his teaching a true commitment to social engagement, a true practical optimism, and a radical sense of care. These qualities are so rare and so critically important, at a time when we in the work force realize that professional architects who choose to shrug their shoulders at the communities they serve in the name of capital centred high design are, in fact, engaging in unsustainable business practices. They, the status quo, are quickly becoming irrelevant. Those who instead choose to remain at the forefront of our field will necessarily have to find new ways to practice. This impossible job would be made even more difficult without people of Aleks’ standard in memory. Losing him would be a devastating loss to the future of the architecture community at Cornell, perpetuating its own acceleration downhill toward uninspired irrelevancy.&rdquo;<br><br>—John Lai, B.Arch &rsquo;16",
"&ldquo;Aleks is an incredible teacher with a well-rounded perspective and passion for exploring architecture with students. Letting him leave would be an unforgivable loss for Cornell.&rdquo;<br><br>—Alexandra Foster, B.Arch &rsquo;17 / Project Designer, MTFA Architecture",
"&ldquo;Phenonmal teacher.&rdquo;<br><br>—Samuel Castaneda, B.Arch &rsquo;23",
"&ldquo;I really would like to see prof. Mergold get tenured. Also, I am surprised he was not tenured in the first place.

"&ldquo;Having both worked and been taught by Aleksandr Mergold, it has been my observation and experience that he pushes his students and employees to develop their projects while maintaining a critical focus on the narrative of the work and its representation (primarily through constructed drawings). Through this critical lens, Professor Mergold, guides his students and employees into discovering (or re-discovering) innovative methods of fabrication and material manipulation. These methods emphasize the re-use and re-interpretation of “standard” building materials. This critical focus of fabrication and material manipulation is easily transferable to the construction of architecture and its innovation while questioning the establishment of Architecture.<br><br>It is really quite a shame that the Cornell AAP faculty have failed to recognize the potential of this work and the value of Professor Mergold’s ability to empower and encourage his students and employees by rejecting his application for tenure.

"&ldquo;It is very important for the college to retain faculty who has building experiences&hairsp;—&hairsp;understand building processes and how buildings are put together. Cornell Architecture Department has a top standing in training strong design architects in this country but they also need to strengthen their students' education in structure, construction and buildability to help them to become top professionals.

I had an opportuniity, and pleasure, to watch his teaching method as well as observe the level of engagement and trust he had developed within professor- student relations with the group. I have found Aleks an enthusiastic and inspiriational educator, both respected and well-liked by students. I would very much like to support him and call upon Cornell University to either revise the negative decision or at least grant prof. Mergold a chance to appeal.
