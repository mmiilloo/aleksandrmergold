				Dear Dean Yoon, Chair Simitch, and the<br> Department of Architecture Faculty,<br><br>
				<p>
					It has come to our attention with great dismay that Assistant Professor of Architecture Aleksandr Mergold, AIA has recently been denied tenure by Cornell Uni&shy;versity without option to appeal. We, the undersigned alumni of the College of Archi&shy;tecture, Art, and Planning alongside his extended network of colleagues and col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rators, believe he deserves tenure. We request that he be given the opportunity to appeal the University's decision, and that AAP Faculty and Administration advocate on his behalf.
				</p><p>
					Based on the depth of our collective experience as Professor Mergold’s past and present students, colleagues and col&shy;lab&shy;ora&shy;tors, we are in strong support of his tenure. His con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions to the school and to the development of its students are integral to Cornell Architecture’s peda&shy;gogy and its standing in the field. We are deeply con&shy;cerned by the impact of this decision on the future of the architecture program at Cornell University. Moreover, this decision has been made in an opaque manner despite significant support from the Department of Architecture, which undermines our trust in the University’s tenure review process.
				</p><p>
					Over the past 12+ years as part of the AAP faculty, Professor Mergold has developed a scholarly body of research and design work that bridges the disciplines of architecture, art (history), landscape, archaeology, and anthropology, among others. As a practicing architect with endless curiosity for design and an un&shy;matched ability to empower his collaborators, Professor Mergold has had a profound impact on countless Cornell Architecture students and faculty. His critical approach to sustainable design as seen in his winning international compe&shy;tition installation <em>Sural Ark</em>, playful but pointed exhibition designs like <em>PS72</em> for Open House New York (organized by Droog and Diller Scofidio + Renfro), and curation of interdisciplinary events like “Spolia: Histories, Spaces, and Processes of Adaptive Reuse,” have inspired a gen&shy;eration of Cornell Architecture students who have gone on to become passionate and proactive architects, academics, entrepreneurs, activists, community members, and change-making citizens of the world.
				</p><p>
					The decision to deny Professor Mergold tenure—following his decade of commitment to the highest quality of inter&shy;dis&shy;ci&shy;pli&shy;nary design practice, pedagogy, and schol&shy;ar&shy;ship around issues of sustainability as seen through the historical and theoretical lens of <em>spolia</em>—is a dev&shy;as&shy;tat&shy;ing loss for the department, college, and university. Professor Mergold has served a critical role within Cornell’s Department of Architecture, demon&shy;strat&shy;ing how the fundamentals of Cornell’s architecture program prepares students to translate experimental, provocative, and progressive ideas into a variety of refined, built designs that can range in scale and span the disciplines of architecture, art, and landscape.
				</p><p>
					In recent years, the Department of Architecture has seen the retirement and passing of several faculty, while others have moved on to academic, administrative, and pro&shy;fessional positions elsewhere. Alongside Professor Mergold, many recent hires have brought with them tech&shy;no&shy;log&shy;ical prowess, funding relationships, and scientific research methods. The program has been strength&shy;ened by these additions to the department, resulting in a faculty cohort with diverse scholarly research and design interests who expose students to multiple ways of thinking, working, and creating. We support the program’s embrace of interdisciplinary collaboration, research-based design, and expanding socially-motivated practice. Professor Mergold’s work simultaneously builds on the humanistic approach of Cornell Architecture’s institutional legacy, and represents the current aspirations of the program, positioning him uniquely to be a leader in both the uni&shy;versity and the discipline of architecture. Without his voice, the unmatched design legacy of Cornell Architecture and the future of the program will both be diminished.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold is an outstanding instructor, mentor, thinker, and practitioner. He excels in teaching both fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal and upper-level design studios, elective seminars, and is a celebrated and sought after thesis advisor. This is due in part to his emphasis on conceptual clarity, graphic rigor, and experimentation in the creative process, as well as his interests in the most urgent issues that the discipline of architecture is faced with. Professor Mergold has co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nat&shy;ed several cohorts of 50+ second-year students and faculty members in design studios focusing on issues of sustain&shy;able design. By working alongside Cornell University Sus&shy;tain&shy;able Design (CUSD) and involving faculty and graduate students in the Department of Engineering, several proto&shy;types for schools in Haiti and South Africa have been developed and proposed to local communities in these regions of the world. Professor Mergold continuously creates op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;nities for his students to become active voices in academia and in practice. During the summer of 2014, he taught an 8-week design studio with B.Arch students in their second to fifth years. The unparalleled success of this experi&shy;ment led to the designs of all students involved being featured at the &ldquo;BIO50: 24<sup>th</sup> Design Biennial in Ljubljana&rdquo; – an international and multidisciplinary exhibition in Slovenia that has been leading discussions in design for over half a century.
				</p><p>
					Furthermore, Professor Mergold’s design studios and seminars consistently deal with larger historical and political questions. Specifically, his knowledge of non-Western architectural traditions—namely Russian and Eastern European architecture—makes him completely singular among the school’s faculty. For example, students in his <em>Design Plan</em> option studio series worked with stakeholders across the globe to investigate and precisely define problems that can be solved with the input of designers and architects. The second installment of its kind, <em>Design Plan 2.0</em>, imagined afterlives for a mid-19th-century farming estate known as <em>Bzionkow</em> in Poland. Aside from exposing the class participants to Polish architects and local stakeholders, the student projects were featured prominently in “Reversing Oblivion,” a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary film about the Upper Silesian estate, that was premiered across Germany throughout 2016 and 2017.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold is one of the few faculty members who truly embraces an interdisciplinary approach, forming relationships with different departments and colleges across Cornell, and within the Ithaca community at large. Take for example his <em>Chain Works District Masterplan</em> done in collaboration with the landscape architects of D.I.R.T. Studio; an adaptive reuse proposal for the former Morse Chain Factory postindustrial site that overlooks Ithaca. As the College pursues a more socially-driven design approach, we believe Professor Mergold is uniquely positioned to lead the school in this direction, both locally and globally. At present, he is among the strongest voices in the school for integrating social, environmental, material, and intellectual practices of architecture, and for collaborating with other disci&shy;plines. This is the foundation of his great popularity among students who see in his work a deeply relevant (and urgently needed) practical methodology.
				</p><p>
					A prime example of Professor Mergold’s ability to communicate and collaborate with constituencies from multiple disciplines was the exhibition and symposium at Cornell's Johnson Museum of Art, titled <em>Unpacking the Nano: The Price of the World’s Most Affordable Car</em>. As the Project Leader, Professor Mergold communicated, co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nat&shy;ed, and collaborated with a team of 15+ people which included former AAP Dean Kent Kleinman, students and faculty across the colleges of AAP, Engineering, and Asian Studies, as well as local fab&shy;ri&shy;ca&shy;tors and NANO factory managers in India. The exhibition and symposium were major successes, in great part due to Professor Mergold’s determination to realize visionary and (literally) out-of-the-box ideas.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold has boundless enthusiasm for design. He is an active architectural practitioner with an extensive port&shy;folio of built work and research, having won inter&shy;national design competitions, exhibition design commissions, and several research grants. He has also edited books like his forthcoming title, <em>Towards an American Spolia: A Loose Inventory of Antecedents and Possibilities</em>, which will undoubtedly lead to further inter&shy;disci&shy;plinary collaborations with notable figures and courses that take a critical position on the architect’s role in the age of the Anthro&shy;pocene. Importantly, Professor Mergold constantly creates oppor&shy;tuni&shy;ties for students and practitioners of other disciplines. He is not only the model of what a well-rounded architect can be—someone involved deeply in practice, research, and teaching, working between all with seamless continuity—but also a design leader, one who foments, creates and facilitates critical con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions and connections with a range of audiences and fields. It is rare to find someone so committed to teaching, building, and thinking critically about architecture as a service discipline.
				</p><p>
					The fact that so many of Professor Mergold’s past and present students, colleagues and collaborators feel so strongly about his irreplaceable value to Cornell is a testament to his strengths as a professor and practitioner, and the meaningful relationships he has formed with us over the years. We believe that denying Professor Mergold tenure is a mistake and request that he, at minimum, be granted the opportunity to appeal this decision.
				</p><p>
					Sincerely,<br>
					Concerned Members of the AAP Community
