         To J. Meejin Yoon, the Gale and Ira Drukier Dean of the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning,<br>
         To Professor Andrea Simich, Chair of Architecture at the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning,<br>
         To the Faculty of the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning,<br>
         Dear Dean Yoon, Chair Simitch, and other members of the Cornell AAP community,<br>It has come to our attention that Assistant Professor of Architecture Aleksandr Mergold, AIA has recently been denied tenure by Cornell University without option to appeal. We, the undersigned alumni of the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, believe he deserves tenure. We demand that he be given the opportunity to appeal the University's decision. Based on the depth of our collective experiences as Professor Mergold’s former students and colleagues, we are in strong support of his tenure. His contributions to the school and to the development of its students are integral to Cornell Architecture’s pedagogy and its standing in the field. This decision has been made in an opaque manner despite significant support, particularly within the Architecture Department undermines our trust in the University’s administration. We are deeply concerned by this decision’s impact on the future of Cornell’s Architecture program. Prof. Mergold contributes a broad design perspective and the denial of his tenure is a great loss for design-focused education, for which Cornell is renowned. We support the program’s embrace of interdisciplinary collaboration, research-based design, and expanding socially-motivated practice. Prof. Mergold’s work builds on Cornell’s institutional legacy of the Texas Rangers and represents the current aspirations of the program, giving him a unique position to be a leader in the school. Without his voice, our rigorous design legacy and the future of the program will both be diminished. In addition to being a bridge between the intellectual foundations of Cornell's design culture and its contemporary pedagogy, Prof. Mergold is an outstanding instructor, mentor, thinker, and practitioner. He excels in teaching both fundamental design courses and upper-level option studios and electives, and he is celebrated and sought after as a thesis advisor. This is due in part to his emphasis on conceptual clarity, graphic rigor, and experimentation. Furthermore, Alex’s architecture studios and seminars almost always deal with larger historical and political questions. In particular, his knowledge of non-Western architectural traditions--namely Russian and Eastern European architecture--makes him completely singular among the school’s faculty. In addition, he is one of the few professors who truly embraces an interdisciplinary approach, forming relationships with different departments and colleges at Cornell, as well as the Ithaca community at large. As the College pursues a more socially-driven design approach, we believe Prof. Mergold is uniquely positioned to lead the school in this direction. At present, he is among the strongest voices in the school for integrating social, environmental, material, and intellectual practices of architecture, and collaborating with other disciplines. This is the foundation of his great popularity among students who see in his work a deeply relevant (and urgently needed) practical methodology. Prof. Mergold is among the most creative, curious, energetic, and approachable professors at AAP. He has boundless enthusiasm for design. He is an active architectural practitioner with an extensive portfolio of built work, including winning international design competition proposals like Sural Ark, exhibition designs like Unpacking the Nano: The Price of the World’s Most Affordable Car, and research projects like Affordable Living for BIO50 at the 24th Design Biannual in Ljubljana, and edited books like his forthcoming Towards an American Spolia: A Loose Inventory of Antecedents and Possibilities, many of which he pursues by involving  students and collaborating with practitioners in other disciplines. He is the model of not just what a well-rounded architect can be—someone involved deeply in practice, research, and teaching, working between all with seamless continuity—but also a design leader, creating critical conversations and connections with other disciplines. It is rare to find someone so committed to teaching, building, and thinking critically about architecture as a service discipline.  The fact that so many of us, former students and colleagues of Prof. Mergold, feel so strongly about his irreplaceable value to Cornell is a testament to his strengths as a professor and the meaningful relationships he has formed with us over the years. We believe that denying Prof. Mergold tenure is a mistake and ask that he, at minimum, be granted the opportunity to appeal this decision. Sincerely, </p>
