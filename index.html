				Dear Dean Yoon, Chair Simitch, and the Department&nbsp;of Architecture&nbsp;Faculty,<br><br>
				<p>
					It has come to our attention with great dismay that Assistant Professor of Architecture Aleksandr Mergold, AIA has recently been denied tenure by Cornell Uni&shy;versity without option to appeal. We, the undersigned alumni of the College of Archi&shy;tecture, Art, and Planning alongside his extended network of colleagues and col&shy;lab&shy;o&shy;rators, believe he has earned tenure. We request that he be given the opportunity to appeal the University’s decision, and that AAP Faculty and Administration advocate on his behalf.
				</p><p>
					Based on the depth of our collective experience as Professor Mergold’s past and present students, colleagues and col&shy;lab&shy;ora&shy;tors, we are in strong support of his tenure. His con&shy;tri&shy;bu&shy;tions to the school and to the development of its students are integral to Cornell Architecture’s peda&shy;gogy and its standing in the field. We are deeply con&shy;cerned by the impact of this decision on the future of the architecture program at Cornell University. Moreover, this decision has been made in an opaque manner despite significant support from the Department of Architecture, which undermines our trust in the University’s tenure review process.
				</p><p>
					Over the past 12+ years as part of the AAP faculty, Professor Mergold has developed a scholarly body of research and design work that bridges the disciplines of architecture, art (history), landscape, archaeology, and anthropology, among others. As a practicing architect with endless curiosity for design and an un&shy;matched ability to empower his collaborators, Professor Mergold has had a profound impact on countless Cornell Architecture students and faculty. His critical approach to sustainable design as seen in his winning international compe&shy;tition installation <em>Sural Ark</em>, playful but pointed exhibition designs like <em>PS72</em> for Open House New York (organized by Droog and Diller Scofidio + Renfro), and curation of interdisciplinary events like “Spolia: Histories, Spaces, and Processes of Adaptive Reuse,” have inspired a gen&shy;eration of Cornell Architecture students who have gone on to become passionate and proactive architects, academics, entrepreneurs, activists, community members, and change-making citizens of the world.
				</p><p>
					The decision to deny Professor Mergold tenure&hairsp;—&hairsp;following his decade of commitment to the highest quality of inter&shy;dis&shy;ci&shy;pli&shy;nary design practice, pedagogy, and schol&shy;ar&shy;ship around issues of sustainability as seen through the historical and theoretical lens of <em>spolia</em>&hairsp;—&hairsp;is a dev&shy;as&shy;tat&shy;ing loss for the department, college, and university. Professor Mergold has served a critical role within Cornell’s Department of Architecture, demon&shy;strat&shy;ing how the fundamentals of Cornell’s architecture program prepares students to translate experimental, provocative, and progressive ideas into a variety of refined, built designs that can range in scale and span the disciplines of architecture, art, and landscape.
				</p><p>
					In recent years, the Department of Architecture has seen the retirement and passing of several faculty, while others have moved on to academic, administrative, and pro&shy;fessional positions elsewhere. Alongside Professor Mergold, many recent hires have brought with them tech&shy;no&shy;log&shy;ical prowess, funding relationships, and scientific research methods. The program has been strength&shy;ened by these additions to the department, resulting in a faculty cohort with diverse scholarly research and design interests who expose students to multiple ways of thinking, working, and creating. We support the program’s embrace of interdisciplinary collaboration, research-based design, and expanding socially-motivated practice. Professor Mergold’s work simultaneously builds on the humanistic approach of Cornell Architecture’s institutional legacy, and represents the current aspirations of the program, positioning him uniquely to be a leader in both the uni&shy;versity and the discipline of architecture. Without his voice, the unmatched design legacy of Cornell Architecture and the future of the program will both be diminished.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold is an outstanding instructor, mentor, thinker, and practitioner. He excels in teaching both fun&shy;da&shy;men&shy;tal and upper-level design studios, elective seminars, and is a celebrated and sought after thesis advisor. This is due in part to his emphasis on conceptual clarity, graphic rigor, and experimentation in the creative process, as well as his interests in the most urgent issues that the discipline of architecture is faced with. Professor Mergold has co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nat&shy;ed several cohorts of 50+ second-year students and faculty members in design studios focusing on issues of sustain&shy;able design. By working alongside Cornell University Sus&shy;tain&shy;able Design (CUSD) and involving faculty and graduate students in the Department of Engineering, several proto&shy;types for schools in Haiti and South Africa have been developed and proposed to local communities in these regions of the world. Professor Mergold continuously creates op&shy;por&shy;tu&shy;nities for his students to become active voices in academia and in practice. During the summer of 2014, he taught an 8-week design studio with B.Arch students in their second to fifth years. The unparalleled success of this experi&shy;ment led to the designs of all students involved being featured at the &ldquo;BIO50: 24<sup>th</sup> Design Biennial in Ljubljana&rdquo; – an international and multidisciplinary exhibition in Slovenia that has been leading discussions in design for over half a century.
				</p><p>
					Furthermore, Professor Mergold’s design studios and seminars consistently deal with larger historical and political questions. Specifically, his knowledge of non-Western architectural traditions&hairsp;—&hairsp;namely Russian and Eastern European architecture&hairsp;—&hairsp;makes him completely singular among the school’s faculty. For example, students in his <em>Design Plan</em> option studio series worked with stakeholders across the globe to investigate and precisely define problems that can be solved with the input of designers and architects. The second installment of its kind, <em>Design Plan 2.0</em>, imagined afterlives for a mid-19th century farming estate known as <em>Bzionkow</em> in Poland. Aside from exposing the class participants to Polish architects and local stakeholders, the student projects were featured prominently in “Reversing Oblivion,” a doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;tary film about the Upper Silesian estate, that was premiered across Germany throughout 2016 and 2017.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold is one of the few faculty members who truly embraces an interdisciplinary approach, forming relationships with different departments and colleges across Cornell, and within the Ithaca community at large. Take for example his <em>Chain Works District Masterplan</em> done in collaboration with the landscape architects of D.I.R.T. Studio; an adaptive reuse proposal for the former Morse Chain Factory postindustrial site that overlooks Ithaca. As the College pursues a more socially-driven design approach, we believe Professor Mergold is uniquely positioned to lead the school in this direction, both locally and globally. At present, he is among the strongest voices in the school for integrating social, environmental, material, and intellectual practices of architecture, and for collaborating with other disci&shy;plines. This is the foundation of his great popularity among students who see in his work a deeply relevant (and urgently needed) practical methodology.
				</p><p>
					A prime example of Professor Mergold’s ability to communicate and collaborate with constituencies from multiple disciplines was the exhibition and symposium at Cornell's Johnson Museum of Art, titled <em>Unpacking the Nano: The Price of the World’s Most Affordable Car</em>. As the Project Leader, Professor Mergold communicated, co&shy;or&shy;di&shy;nat&shy;ed, and collaborated with a team of 15+ people which included former AAP Dean Kent Kleinman, students and faculty across the colleges of AAP, Engineering, and Asian Studies, as well as local fab&shy;ri&shy;ca&shy;tors and NANO factory managers in India. The exhibition and symposium were major successes, in great part due to Professor Mergold’s determination to realize visionary and (literally) out-of-the-box ideas.
				</p><p>
					Professor Mergold has boundless enthusiasm for design. He is an active architectural practitioner with an extensive port&shy;folio of built work and research, having won inter&shy;national design competitions, exhibition design commissions, and several research grants. He has also edited books like his forthcoming title, <em>Towards an American Spolia: A Loose Inventory of Antecedents and Possibilities</em>, which will undoubtedly lead to further inter&shy;disci&shy;plinary collaborations with notable figures and courses that take a critical position on the architect’s role in the age of the Anthro&shy;pocene. Importantly, Professor Mergold constantly creates oppor&shy;tuni&shy;ties for students and practitioners of other disciplines. He is not only the model of what a well-rounded architect can be&hairsp;—&hairsp;someone involved deeply in practice, research, and teaching, working between all with seamless continuity&hairsp;—&hairsp;but also a design leader, one who foments, creates and facilitates critical con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tions and connections with a range of audiences and fields. It is rare to find someone so committed to teaching, building, and thinking critically about architecture as a service discipline.
				</p><p>
					The fact that so many of Professor Mergold’s past and present students, colleagues and collaborators feel so strongly about his irreplaceable value to Cornell is a testament to his strengths as a professor and practitioner, and the meaningful relationships he has formed with us over the years. We believe that denying Professor Mergold tenure is a mistake and request that he, at minimum, be granted the opportunity to appeal this decision.
				</p><p>
					Sincerely,<br>
					Concerned Members of the AAP Community

								Our M.Arch class of 2011 had Professor Mergold as a digital drawing instructor during the spring semester of 2008. His course serendipitously provided a creative outlet for many of us. His drawing course reflected the importance of the design process and exuberant creativity and humor. His encouragements, his generosity as a faculty and his constant availability for each one of us were treasured. Professor Mergold’s role outside of class extended far beyond the classroom. The learning environment he crafted through his course extended throughout our time at Cornell. In fact, many of us collaborated with him on competitions, exhibitions, and design-build projects outside the scope of the school-year. His work within the department and professional served as a guide for our future aspirations. <mark>During our time at Cornell, Professor Mergold’s shepherding and design of the <em>Unpacking the Nano</em> exhibition and symposium served as an exemplar of design ambition.</mark> To many of us, Professor Mergold offered experiences outside of the curriculum that were paramount to our current careers, research and design practice interests. <mark>Furthermore, many of us taught alongside him in the Career Discovery summer studio. Thanks to his valuable pedagogical exposure to teaching, some of us went on to pursue academic positions in universities across the U.S.</mark> The loss of Professor Mergold is decimating: we implore the administration to review its decision and take the concerns of the alumni into account.

								The Bachelors of Architecture Class of 2012 collectively supports Aleksandr Mergold’s tenure at Cornell University’s College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. It has come to our attention that despite our class’s exceptional academic experiences with Alex, he was recently denied tenure by the university. We implore you to reconsider this decision.
								<br><br>
								Our class was taught by Aleksandr on several occasions during our time at Cornell AAP, notably during the Cornell in Rome program during our 4th year studio. Some of us also traveled abroad with him as part of the Eastern Horizons summer travel studio. For some of us, he was a thesis advisor.
								<br><br>
								Aleksandr represents an era of Cornell alumni who can bridge the current aging tenured faculty with a generation of the new, <mark>he is someone who knows the deep traditions of Cornell Architecture’s pedagogy and can continue to maintain relevance to the contemporary dialogue of today and tomorrow.</mark>
								<br><br>
								<mark>We could not imagine the experience at Cornell’s program without Alex’s tutelage and guidance that allowed us to thrive as successful practitioners today.</mark> Alex was a cornerstone to our architectural education, and for the University to miss the opportunity to have Alex this crucial role we believe would be a grave error for current and future Cornellians.							</div>

								<br><br>
								When we, the B.Arch Class of 2013, began our journey together twelve years ago, entering our first year of architecture at Cornell, we did so under the charismatic, dynamic studio instruction of Professor Aleksandr Mergold. A young practitioner and graduate of the program himself, Professor Mergold was just beginning his career as a scholar and educator, bringing with him new ideas from his strong record of progressive practice in New York City. <mark>An animated leader, Professor Mergold inducted us into the unique culture and training that defines the architecture program at Cornell and laid the foundations for our valuable contributions to our respective firms, companies, proprietorships, institutions, and communities today.</mark> He urged us to learn and leverage the tools of construction, lessons reinforced by his own frequent presence in the fabrication facilities as he completed research and design work deeply engaged with the physical world. Our first year studio work was even captured elegantly in the Elemental Instrumental books that he co-authored.
								<br><br>
								Beyond studio, Professor Mergold connected with us during informal moments. Equally important lessons and fond memories linger from our studio trips to upstate New York hamlets like Hammondsport, downtown Ithaca and major cultural institutions like the Dia: Beacon. Professor Mergold framed the longstanding traditions of Cornell Architecture as part or our education, giving us a week off of our individual studio assignments so that we could focus on our first collective planning, design, and construction effort, Dragon Day. Professor Mergold showed us how our creativity could engage seemingly banal tasks; he brought pumpkins for the entire freshmen class to carve on Halloween and staged a carving competition. <mark>Embedded in these moments was a creative culture which was simultaneously rigorous and fun. We learned to take joy in working hard and making creative discoveries&hairsp;—&hairsp;an invaluable lifelong skill that allows us to find meaning and fulfillment in our livelihoods.</mark>
								<br><br>
								In the years since, Professor Mergold has built up an esteemed career as an exemplary practitioner, scholar, and educator. <mark>He has built up a leading presence in the discipline and progressive body of work that powerfully addresses the climate imperative and engages with the cultural impli&shy;cations of intervening in the built environment</mark>, all from the difficult context of Ithaca, a community in which he is a loyal and devoted resident. His work demonstrates the power architecture has to address global concerns, and the importance of engaging various stakeholders and collaborators in such efforts.
								<br><br>
								Professor Mergold has been a friend, mentor, and role model to our class and others, a friendly face among architecture faculty, pulling off an endearing lightheartedness even when dealing with serious, important lessons. When we lost Professor Mergold for a year, our final year, to the College of Human Ecology, a void was felt across the architecture program. We were ecstatic when he made a tri&shy;umphant return, securing a tenure track position in architecture following our graduation. Today, we hope that you will consider the irreparable damage to Cornell Architecture that will result from losing Professor Mergold. <mark>He plays not only a vital role in continuing and expanding the pedagogy and culture of the program, but also in bringing together the larger university, Ithaca, and the discipline to address the most pressing issues of our time.</mark>							</div>

								When we arrived at Cornell in 2009, Aleks was one of our first professors. <mark>He became a role model for us, showing us who we could become as Cornell-educated architects.</mark> He is driven, creative, inspiring, and generous, with boundless energy for design. While we were students and since, he has consistently produced built work, submitted winning competition entries, and designed exhibits, all in addition to teaching full-time. Out of all AAP faculty, he is among the most deserving of tenure.
								<br><br>
								Aleks taught our class several times during our time at Cornell: first-year studio, comprehensive design, and architectural analysis. Some of us also traveled abroad with him as part of the Eastern Horizons summer travel studio. For others, he was a thesis advisor.
								<br><br>
								<mark>Those early studio and theory courses are the foundation of our architectural education, delivered in a thoughtful, relevant, and engaging way. During our first year, Aleks introduced us to the principles of conceptual clarity, the significance of site, and the importance of iteration and exploration.</mark> As our second year comprehensive studio coordinator, he organized a collaboration with CUSD, acting as a bridge between students and professors in AAP, DEA, and CEE, as well as active practitioners in the field. He helped to facilitate input from not only architects and engineers, but also voices from NGOs and playground designers. The project ultimately culminated in a built school in Cosmo City, South Africa. To this day, he facilitates similar conversations and collaborations, increasing the agency of design within and beyond the University.

								<mark>Toward the latter part of our academic careers and beyond, many of us have turned to him as a mentor and an example of someone who holds academia and the profession in perfect balance.</mark> Aleks is one of the most generous, dependable, and inspiring professors to us. We hope that future generations of Cornell students will be able to say the same.

		            The 2015 M.Arch class fully support Alex Mergold in his application for tenure. While our class was not fortunate enough to have Professor Mergold in studio, some of us were his teaching assistants, thesis mentees and elective students. In addition, our experience with Alex as a frequent and insightful critic on design juries was vital to our growth as students. Alex is a leading light in the department with real construction and interdisciplinary experience. <mark>By incorporating this learned knowledge through his teaching of construction details and design processes, Alex is able to show students how to match creativity with practicality in a way that is all too rare in our field today.</mark> Alex has been a constant and unwavering supporter of his students and former students and we feel pride in standing with him so that he may continue to play an important role in the lives of those at Cornell.

								<br><br>
								Asst. Professor Aleksandr Mergold had a tremendous influence on the M.Arch class of 2016, and we are writing to enthusiastically support his tenure. Though we did not have the opportunity to participate in one of his studios, we benefited enormously from his unique and incisive voice throughout our time at AAP, from our first year drawing class through to his role as our thesis critic. <mark>Many of us cite Aleks as the most formative figure in both our education at Cornell and our current practice.</mark>
								<br><br>
								One of the many valuable roles Professor Mergold had in our education at Cornell was his interpretation of reuse/ repurpose/ reinvention. Many of us participated in his 2015 seminar, “DI-DE-RE / Design for Dis- and Re-Assembly”, which challenged the dominant language of upcycling and recycling in conversations about resource conservation in the built environment. With Professor Mergold, we explored vernacular construction methods to guide the design of our own prototype assemblies. The conference on the topic of Spolia that Professor Mergold spearheaded concurrently further enriched our conversations about respect for architectural resources & embodied cultural memory in the built environment.
								<br><br>
								In his discussions of material re-use, Professor Mergold is able to seamlessly integrate discussions of theory, classics of the western and non-western world, environmental standards, ethical practice, and social impact in addition to encouraging us to be bold and inventive with our designs. <mark>These lessons, for many of those in our class, were the ones that drew us to the field of architecture, and proved to be the most relevant in our practice since.</mark> We just see in our own professional experiences that there is a need for an environmentally resilient, deeply collaborative (and aesthetically playful!) way of tackling challenges in the built environment. <mark>Professor Mergold is the one that we all felt really gets it.</mark>
								<br><br>
								Professor Mergold is a unique, authentic, and grounding presence for the architectural program at the school. He works with students thoughtfully and without airs. We believe that the profession needs to build more bridges with other fields, something that his classes supported. His positions and interests preserve the elements that link Cornell AAP to the legacy of Colin Rowe, while pushing elements of that framework to embrace contemporary practices and invention. We firmly believe that the architecture program will maintain greater relevance if it maintains diversity in the voices of its faculty and provide a well-rounded educational experience, in this way Professor Mergold greatly enriches the program.
								<br><br>
								The school will be greatly impoverished without Professor Mergold’s interpretation of the profession, sense of humor, and commitment to his students. We urge the University to reconsider its decision to deny him tenure, and offer him an appeal.

								As members of the B.Arch Class of 2016, we are writing in proud support of Alex Mergold’s tenure. Both before and after graduation, Alex has been a cherished mentor for many of us and we have found that his insights form an invaluable bridge between the profession and academia.
								<br><br>
								The studios Alex taught in 2014 and 2015 focused on designing “from the middle,” as he put it, rather than from the top-down or the bottom-up.  In Trumansburg, NY and Dobrodzien, Poland, we grappled with this approach by learning about the multivalent histories of these places and talking with the people who lived there. We explored designs that both put forward radical architectural propositions and took into account the needs and desires of the inhabitants.  Alex was an expert at helping students see a seemingly mundane situation as an opportunity for extraordinary and provocative projects. Furthermore, his studios complicated and problematized the ways in which the design process had been presented to us before. We felt encouraged to challenge what we had previously been taught to accept. Alex treats fourth-year students like thesis students and thesis students like colleagues, empowering them to think critically and conceive of projects which feel truly their own. Alex’s studios reinvigorated the study of architecture for many of us and continue to inspire our professional ambitions and design approaches.
								<br><br>
								Alex occupies a unique and inspiring position at the intersection of academia and the architectural profession. Many of us found this invaluable in navigating the tenuous transition between the two. In addition to an impressive portfolio of built work, he is one of the few professors who maintains NCARB licensure and AIA membership. His commitment to the profession instills optimism in students about the prospect of becoming an architect. Alex understands the realities of constructing a building as part of the design process. This allows him to offer pragmatic and ethical insights about construction, feasibility, and economy. Not only does this make students more conscious of the technical side of architecture, it teaches them how to embrace the complexities and peculiarities of the profession.
								<br><br>
								As young professionals who had Alex as a teacher and mentor, we have an even clearer picture of how instrumental his role was in our growth as architects and ethical designers. It is disheartening to see that the program we care about so much would deny tenure to someone who made our time at Cornell so purposeful. Alex Mergold is an indispensable asset to the AAP community. In light of our perspective as dedicated alumni, we ask that you revisit his tenure application.

								<br><br>
									Straddling the realms of architecture, art, ecology, industrial and graphic design, landscape, materials science, among others, Aleks is not only a leading practitioner and transdisciplinary designer, but also an excellent teacher and mentor.
									<br><br>
									Under his leadership as the 2<sup>nd</sup> year studio coordinator, he urged us to <mark>consider design&rsquo;s agency amidst unresting political and ecological climates.</mark> We developed designs and prototypes for a school in Haiti in response to the disaster-stricken area, while collaborating with a non-profit student organization and the College of Engineering. Aleks fought hard to make us see that &ldquo;big picture&rdquo;—&hairsp;thinking and details both mattered, and having external perspectives from the community and other disciplines makes a powerful design. Also under his guidance, Aleks taught us how to <mark>use archi&shy;tecture as a powerful storytelling tool</mark> that resulted in strong manifestos for a changing world through the elective studios he led in Trumansburg, NY, Ithaca, NY, and Dobrodzień, Poland.
									<br><br>
									Additionally, Aleks was unique in the university, let alone the college, in showing us <mark>design’s capacity to be an inter&shy;discipli&shy;nary connector.</mark> This was evident in his roles as advisor and founder of RAW EXPO, Cornell’s first design expo that hosted over 500 people from all 7 colleges who exhibited their unique design processes at the Milstein Dome. He also advised the development of Medium Design Collective, a student organization focused on connecting design disciplines at Cornell, which continued to solidify AAP as a design connector at the university.
									<br><br>
									Still, maybe it does Aleks a disservice to write so enthu&shy;sias&shy;ti&shy;cally about his design methodologies when he is also extremely generous and caring. Aleks goes well beyond the call of duty to help students get involved with his and other practitioners’ works. He propagates new opportunities but also creates them, letting students take control and learn by doing, all the while tackling important local and global issues.

								Aleks is one of few licensed architects that simultaneously teaches in the school and produces built work on a consistent basis. His independent projects and collaborations with faculty from the College have been published in distinguished journals and newspapers, such as the New York Times, Domus, and Interior Design Magazine. His absence from the community would be a loss of a dedicated role-model and mentor for all of us that wish to succeed in the field of architecture and design in general.
								<br><br>
								Professor Mergold’s reputation is not solely based on his professional achievements, as his role in defining the pedagogical foundations of the school is substantial and ongoing. He is consistently asked to teach first-year studios for Masters of Architecture students: a highly formative year that depends on a rigorous and challenging approach, combining theoretical reasoning and a practical knowledge of the built environment that students would be hard pressed to find in another professor. When asked to teach his own upper-level design studios, Aleks invites students to participate in the design and construction of their work, which is an especially rare opportunity at Cornell. These studios teach designers to work collaboratively and consider sustainability in provocative and innovative ways. Further, Aleks’ work as an advisor to independent design projects is an invaluable resource for the school and its students. Two of the four thesis awards designated at our commencement were for projects that Aleks advised, and our graduating year is not unique in this regard.

								<br><br>
								The MArch Class of 2019 got to know Aleks Mergold on a number of occasions
								throughout our time at AAP.
								<br><br>
								Those who worked with Aleks on the Governor’s Island installation of his Oculi project
								came to know him as a practicing architect, <mark>whose visionary projects seamlessly bridge
								the limitless and theoretical nature of academia with the practicalities of construction
								and adaptive reuse.</mark>
								<br><br>
								Those who embarked with him to Armenia for the fifth iteration in his Design/Plan Option
								Studio series came to know Aleks as a dedicated professor, a knowledgeable tour
								guide, and an insightful critic, <mark>whose studio assignments tackled challenging and
								important questions and whose leadership fostered meaningful collaborations across
								disciplines and across the globe.</mark>
								<br><br>
								In our Pre-thesis Seminar, <mark>Aleks made the daunting task of developing a thesis
								proposal feel approachable, through a series of exercises that proved almost anything
								can be a “thesis-able” opportunity to engage critically with the discipline.</mark> Those who
								were fortunate to continue their thesis work with Aleks as an advisor came to know him
								as a devoted mentor, whose infectious enthusiasm, generous imagination, and
								unwavering support bring out the very best in his students and their work.
								<br><br>
								The Class of 2019 stands in full  support of Aleksandr Mergold’s tenure due to his invaluable lessons and lasting impact on our student and professional careers. We are disheartened by the department’s possible loss of an exemplary professor; as Professor Mergold’s deep and lasting contributions to the evolving pedagogy of Cornell Architecture were ubiquitous throughout our architectural design education and beyond. Looking towards the future we believe that this decision to deny him tenure is profoundly detrimental to the future potential of the College and to the enrichment of its student body.
							</div>
							<br><br>
								<div id="class-heading">A Note from the B.Arch Class of 2019</div>

								Mergold consistently challenges students to think critically about not only their design, but the entire ecosystem of sourcing, construction, and stakeholder input in which design occurs. This is a rare opportunity in any design education, and one that sets his studios and mentorship apart. His continual investment in encouraging students to expand their design education beyond the confines of AAP has allowed us to truly experience the immense value of interdisciplinary collaboration. Furthermore, Mergold’s rare collaborative approach to teaching empowers his students to create rigorous projects that we genuinely felt were our own. Many from our class who partook in his upper-level design studios look back and understand the professional growth that developed from the agency given to us over not only our own projects, but our education as a whole.
								<br><br>
								Perhaps most importantly, Aleks has cultivated in us a deep and genuine appreciation for the diversity and reality of the architectural world beyond academia&hairsp;—&hairsp;for the unheralded labor and consideration that goes into making a regular two-story house, a wooden barn, or a factory shed. He is also one of the only instructors who we’ve seen give “Joe from Trumansburg” just as much of a say in the design of a studio project as another designer. That Aleks collaborates with stakeholders rather than claiming to speak for them truly demonstrates the integrity in his “design from the middle” ethos. In a world in which design is increasingly framed as a luxury commodity, Mergold’s ethos of learning from the vernacular, non-exploitative labor practices, and design that centers occupants over profit are crucial to defining the way that Cornell Architecture projects its pedagogy to the design world. Denial of his tenure strikes us as a rejection of Cornell’s often-stated commitment to <em>design with</em> over <em>design for</em>.
								<br><br>
								Based on current tenured faculty employed in the department, we understand that the department knows that a faculty member’s value to the College is not limited to their built work, but embodied in their significant and ongoing contribution to the department’s foundational pedagogy. Knowing that Mergold’s work has reached and exceeded the existing standards of built and theoretical work produced by tenured professors in the architecture department, we find the decision to deny tenure questionable and in contradiction with precedent. The opaqueness of the tenure process has decimated the trust that we, the alumni, put into the University and legacy of the program. This decision effectively silences an entire decade of students, and we as a class <mark>strongly</mark> urge the department to reconsider this decision.
								<br><br>
								As young professionals who have had Mergold as a teacher and mentor, we say with confidence that Mergold has left a profound effect on how we interact with the design world as a whole&hairsp;—&hairsp;through our design rigor, our code of ethics, and our agency. We are not alone as a class when we say that our time here would be incomplete without his contribution and dedication.
